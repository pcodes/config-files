# New year, new config system!
Now that I get paid to use Linux, I've learned a few things about how to better manage my configs / manage a fresh install. Is this...documentation?

## Order of operations on a new system
1. Install core packages (what are they? Unclear, read on)
2. Set up SSH key, add to Github (can be done with Github tool)
3. Clone config files repo, create symlinks for things
